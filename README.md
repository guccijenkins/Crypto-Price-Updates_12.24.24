**CLOUD SERVER**
I used this cloud server (https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to run the code once per day (free version only allows for code to run once a day).


**.ENV Variables**
All of the "os.getenv" variables need to be included into the main.py file in the cloud server abobe for the code to work properly.


**OUTPUT**

Output is an email sent with 5 price updates at time of server run. See picture below.
